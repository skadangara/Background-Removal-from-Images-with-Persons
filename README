Please find the below details for executing the code.
    a. For background removal of images, I created a deep learning pre-trained model using DeepLabV3 on Pytorch library. This will remove
        the background of images which contain atleast one person. (Try to use images contain human beings).
        
        Pre-requisites:
        ! pip install opencv-python
        ! pip install torchvision --user
     
    b. Created a web service using flask which will locally deploy this model.
        Both removeBg.py and img_seg_torch.ipynb files will act as flask apis
        
        If the image is in remote location
             
             use: http://127.0.0.1:5000/remove_img_background API for testing, along with request, pass online image-url as url 
             
             Send url as json format as below:
             {
               "url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/691700243809718272/z7XZUARB_400x400.jpg"
             }
        
        If the image is in local path 
             use: http://127.0.0.1:5000/rm_img_bg_local  API for testing, along with request pass local path as image_path as data
             Send image_path as json format as below:
             {
                "image_path": "C:/Users/sajana/Projects/images/aroni-arsa-children-little.jpg"
             }
